This is the front page of the code written for a research project that aims to quantify the realness of an image, be it real or AI-generated, using a number.


Here is the Notion Doc where we have centralised all of our knowledge and the progress of the project:

Here is the repository, which is the parent repository, and that has all the code written for this project since its inception:

Here is a repository which only had code necessary to run the client used to collect subjective ratings from subjects about the realness of an image:
https://github.com/image-realness-regressor-code/image-api-minimal

Here is the repository containing code to train a simple CNN and get it to output a score for the realness of an image:
